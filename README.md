[00:00.02] In sleep he sang to me
[00:22.59] In dreams he came
[00:26.56] That voice which calls to me
[00:30.52] And speaks my name
[00:34.53] And do I dream again
[00:38.45] For now I find
[00:43.50] The Phantom of the Opera is there
[00:50.51] Inside my mind
[00:57.51] 
[01:02.24] Sing once again with me
[01:06.40] Our strange duet
[01:10.44] My power over you
[01:14.22] Grows stronger yet
[01:18.57] And though you turn from me
[01:22.31] To glance behind
[01:27.43] The Phantom of the Opera is there￼￼
[01:34.52] Inside your mind
[01:42.52] 
[01:46.53] Those who have seen your face
[01:50.41] Draw back in fear
[01:54.44] I am the mask you wear
[01:58.48] It's me they hear
[02:06.98] 
[02:02.40] My (your) spirit and my (your) voice
[02:06.58] In one combined
[02:11.48] The Phantom of the Opera is there
[02:18.55] Inside my (your) mind
[02:29.05] 
[02:22.44] He's there
[02:22.89] The Phantom of the Opera
[02:27.45] Beware
[02:29.41] The Phantom of the Opera
[02:41.41] 
[02:38.49] In all your fantasies
[02:42.55] You always knew
[02:46.42] That man and mystery
[02:50.42] Were both in you
[02:54.54] And in this labyrinth
[02:58.48] Where night is blind
[03:03.44] The Phantom of the Opera is there
[03:10.58] Inside my (your) mind
[03:21.08] 
[03:14.94] Sing
[03:16.24] Sing, my angel of music
[03:19.59] He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
[03:27.39] Sing
[03:29.39] 
[03:27.85] Sing for me
[03:33.35] 
[03:35.94] Sing my angel
[03:42.44] 
[04:07.61] Sing
[04:10.63] Sing for me
